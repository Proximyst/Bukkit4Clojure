# Bukkit4Clojure

This wrapper is for any developer who wishes to develop Bukkit using the LISP-based language Clojure.

NOTE: This project has been adopted by [cpmcdaniel](https://github.com/cpmcdaniel) and future work will
continue on his fork, [cpmcdaniel/Bukkit4Clojure](https://github.com/cpmcdaniel/Bukkit4Clojure).

## Installation

Simply download from the download the current (WIP) source and install that, or use Clojars.

Leiningen and Boot are the main build systems for Clojure, and use Clojars with a Maven backend.

You can add the library by using them, and adding [the following dependency](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.proximyst/bukkit-for-clojure) in the `project.clj` file:
```clojure
  :dependencies [ [org.clojars.proximyst/bukkit-for-clojure "1.0.1"] ]
```

## Usage

##### Loading the plugin
Add this to your plugin.yml:

```yaml
main: com.proximyst.bukkitforclojure.Main
```
Assuming you didn't use the plugin [redbadger/shade](https://github.com/redbadger/shade) or alike to relocate.

Relocating is however highly recommended, nonetheless, as more than 1 plugin may be defined.

And add this to your clojure.yml:

```yaml
clojure: yourns.yourclj
```

In order to get data about the actual `Plugin` instance, use `Main/getInstance` to get an instance, or call something like this, but with the info you wish to get:

```clojure
(def logger (.getLogger (Main/instance)) ; Main also has Main/getLogger defined for this.
```

##### Actual use of plugin
Standard methods like onEnable and onDisable are also allowed to be used:

```clojure
; called on Plugin#onLoad, due to the semantics of Clojure & Java
(.info (Main/getLogger) "o it loaded")
(defn onEnable ; Can also be on-enable.
  []
  (.info (Main/sLogger) "o it enabled")
  )
(defn onDisable ; Can also be on-disable.
  []
  (.info (Main/sLogger) "o it disabled")
  )
```
##### Registering events
To register events you'll first need a method with an event as a param, whether it's type hinted or not:
```clojure
(defn playerQuit
  [^PlayerQuitEvent event]
  (.info (Main/sLogger) (str (-> event .getPlayer .getName) " has quit the server."))
  )
```

To now register this, you'll need to do this in the onEnable, but remember to call use on it first:
```clojure
(.registerEvent (Main/getInstance) PlayerQuitEvent (EventPriority/NORMAL) playerQuit))
```

##### Register commands
To register commands, you'll need a pretty standard onCommand method somewhere, but it will only work for the commands you assign to the specific method:
```clojure
(defn clojureCommand
  [^CommandSender sender
   ^Command command
   ^String label
   & args] ; Type hinting String arrays isnt possible, thus we don't have any type of it, and rather just use it like a collection within clojure.
  (.info (Main/sLogger) (str (-> command .getName .toUpperCase) " was executed!"))
  )
```
And now onto actually registering the command, again in onEnable:
```clojure
(.registerCommand (Main/getInstance) "pluginYmlName" clojureCommand)
```
And register the command like you always would in the plugin.yml.
All exceptions thrown are caught with output, unless they're instance of Return.
